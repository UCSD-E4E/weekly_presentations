\begin{frame}{Focus Area: Improving Existing Pipeline}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enhance the processing stages of the pipeline rather than building new scanning or VR technologies.
        \item Use a new ML-Based feature detector which works well for low-light, low-texture environments.
    \end{itemize}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research and Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conduct a comprehensive review of current SOTA SLAM technologies for low-light, GPS-denied environments.
        \item Compare existing approaches with alternatives found.
        \item Evaluate using metrics like loop closure error, accuracy, and processing time which were tested in the original paper.
    \end{itemize}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Action Plan}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Obtain and Inspect Existing Docker Pipeline
        \item Begin testing and integrating new feature detectors.
        \item Maybe switch to iPhones for scanning.
    \end{itemize}
